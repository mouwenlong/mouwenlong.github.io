== About me
Welcome to my homepage!
I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Toronto. I recently obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of EECS, UC Berkeley, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/ Prof. Martin Wainwright] and [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/ Prof. Peter Bartlett]. Prior to Berkeley, I received B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University in 2017, where I was very fortunate to work with [http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/wangliwei/ Prof. Liwei Wang]. 

== Research
My research interests are broadly in statistics, machine learning theory, dynamic programming and optimization, and applied probability. In particular, I develop optimal statistical methods that enable optimal decision making, powered with efficient computational algorithms. Currently, I work on the following topics:
- Theory of reinforcement learning with function approximation, geometry of Bellman equations, statistical complexity of reinforcement learning
- Non-asymptotic theory of semi-parametric statistics, finite-sample optimal methods for treatment effect estimation
- Stochastic approximation algorithms under statistical settings, interplay between geometry, stochastic processes and optimization
- Discretization of diffusion processes, high-dimensional MCMC algorithms, Bayesian posterior contraction

== Recruiting
I am actively seeking Ph.D. students. Please see [./recruiting.html the post] for detailed information. If you are interested in collaborating with me, please don't hesitate to reach out. However, please be aware that I receive a high volume of emails daily, which may lead to some delays in my response. Your patience in this regard is greatly appreciated. Thank you.
