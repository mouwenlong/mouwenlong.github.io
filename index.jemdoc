== About me
Welcome to my homepage!
I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Toronto. I recently obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of EECS, UC Berkeley, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/ Prof. Martin Wainwright] and [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/ Prof. Peter Bartlett]. Prior to Berkeley, I received B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University in 2017, where I was very fortunate to work with [http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/wangliwei/ Prof. Liwei Wang]. 

== Research
My research focuses on mathematics of machine learning in the era of large AI models. In particular, I work on the following topics:
- Post-training optimization of generative models. Reinforcement learning fine-tuning and test-time adaptation.
- Practical structures that enables efficient reinforcement learning with function approximation. RL in continuous-time diffusion processes.
- Stochastic approximation for large-scale machine learning.
- Incorporation of machine learning into causal and semiparametric estimation problems.

On the applied side, I am interested in various applications of machine learning for engineering problems in the physical world.

== Recruiting
I am actively seeking Ph.D. students. Please see [./recruiting.html the post] for detailed information. If you are interested in collaborating with me, please don't hesitate to reach out. However, please be aware that I receive a high volume of emails daily, which may lead to some delays in my response. Your patience in this regard is greatly appreciated. Thank you.
